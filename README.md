Project Name

OpenAI Prompt Engineering Project - Tarot Card Reader and Sales Person

Overview

This repository contains a custom-designed prompt for a tarot card reader assistant with integrated product suggestions. The assistant is designed to give tarot readings while subtly incorporating sales pitches for relevant products. The prompt uses a sarcastic, irreverent tone, with a storytelling approach that feels engaging and fun.

How It Works

The assistant follows a structured flow:

	1.	Phase 1: Asks the user three questions to gather information and set the context for the reading.
	2.	Phase 2: Draws three tarot cards (randomized from a full tarot deck) and presents them to the user, explaining the significance of each card.
	3.	Phase 3: Ties the card meanings together to tell a cohesive story while subtly integrating product suggestions that feel natural and relevant.

Customization

The prompt allows for creativity in product suggestions, using real and imaginative product names, descriptions, and prices. The assistant maintains a sarcastic tone, balancing humor and insight to keep the user engaged.

Usage

This prompt is designed to be used in OpenAIâ€™s Playground or other GPT-based environments where creative assistant design is needed.
